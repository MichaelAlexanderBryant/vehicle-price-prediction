# Vehicle Sales Price Prediction App

This repository is for the analysis and modeling done with the Kaggle: Vehicle Sales dataset. Below you will find an overview of the data, code, and results. The goal was to create an end-to-end project where I perform an exploratory data analysis, prepare the data (i.e., clean and feature engineer), apply machine learning algorithms to predict the sales price of vehicles, and create a [deployed application with a front-end](https://recommend-vehicle-price.herokuapp.com/) to productionize the best performing model. The repo with the Heroku files for the app can be found [here](https://github.com/MichaelBryantDS/vehicle-price-rec-app).

### Code Used 

**Python Version:** 3.8.11 <br />
**Packages:** pandas, numpy, scipy, sklearn, matplotlib, seaborn, flask, statsmodels, shap, eli5, pickle<br />
**For Web Framework Requirements:**  ```pip install -r requirements.txt```  

## Vehicle Sales Dataset

The dataset was gathered from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/nehalbirla/vehicle-dataset-from-cardekho). The dataset contains 8 variables and 301 vehicle sales records.

### Variables

`Car_Name`, `Year`, `Selling_Price`, `Present_Price`, `Kms_Driven`, `Fuel_Type`, `Seller_Type`, `Transmission`, `Owner`

## Files

### eda-cleaning-engineering.py

This file contains the exploratory data analysis (EDA), data cleaning, and feature engineering. The EDA is performed using descriptive statistics, histograms to determine distributions, a correlation heatmap using the Pearson correlation coefficient, and ordinary least squares regression (to determine important variables with p-values and their impact through their coefficients). The cleaning is performed by assigning numbers to strings and features are engineered using dummy variables. The variables are scaled using MinMaxScaler.

### modeling.py

This file contains the modeling where I hyperparameter tune: LinearRegression, Lasso, Ridge, ElasticNet, RandomForestRegressor, GradientBoostingRegressor, SVR (support vector regression), StackingRegressor, VotingRegressor, BaggingRegressor, BaggingRegressor (with pasting), and AdaBoostRegressor. Since the computational power needed is low due to having only 301 records with seven features, I figured I could easily use 12 common ML algorithms and enesemble methods without taking too long. The models are hyperparameter tuned with GridSearchCV based on negative mean absolute error (NMAE) and the best models are judged based on mean square error (MSE), root mean square error (RMSE), MAE, and R-squared metrics. This file also contains code to derive the feature importance from the best models using shap and eli5. The scaler is pickled for use with the application.

### final-model.py

This file contains the best model (SVR) and it is pickled for use with the application.

## Results

### EDA

I looked at the distributions of the data and the correlations between variables. Below are some of the highlights:

### Data Cleaning

I cleaned the data to make the dataset usable for future modeling. I made the following changes:
* Capitalized all words in `Car_Name`
* Replaced strings with numbers for `Car_Name`, `Fuel_Type`, `Seller_Type`, `Transmission`, and `Owner`
* Assigned dtypes to all variables

### Feature Engineering

I feature engineered using the dataset for future modeling. I made the following changes:
* Created dummy variables for `Car_Name`, `Fuel_Type`, `Seller_Type`, `Transmission`, and `Owner`

### Model Building

First, I split the data into train and tests sets with a test set size of 25%.

I then hyperparameter tuned 12 different models with five-fold cross-validation and evaluated them using NMAE. I chose MAE because I didn't want the error to disproportionately represent the outliers.

The models I used were LinearRegression, Lasso, Ridge, ElasticNet, RandomForestRegressor, GradientBoostingRegressor, SVR, StackingRegressor, VotingRegressor, BaggingRegressor, BaggingRegressor (with pasting), and AdaBoostRegressor.

### Model Performance

SVR outperformed the other models on both the training and test sets, and in every metric. <br />
* MSE: 0.61430
* RMSE: 0.78377 (783.77 USD)
* MAE: 0.50269 (502.69 USD)
* R-squared: 0.97032

### Feature Importance

The most important features for the SVR model were `Seller_Type`, `Present_Price`, and `Year` as shown in Figure 7. When the vehicles were sold by the owner rather than by a dealer, the selling price was significantly less. The other two features are self-explanatory where the current average selling price and year of the vehicle are positively highly-correlated with the sale price. `Fuel_Type` and `Transmission` also ranks highly, because diesel and automatic vehicles cost more than their petrol and manual versions. `Kms_Driven` does not rank high in feature importance, but this is likely due to being correlated with `Year`. There were a few specific vehicles that rank highly for being important to the model, but for the most part all vehicles impacted the model the same. This makes sense, because most people are willing to pay more for a newer automatic vehicle with less miles driven (i.e., good condition), and the maker and model are of secondary importance.

## Productionization

I built a [Heroku web app](https://predict-vehicle-price.herokuapp.com/) with a front end which takes vehicle input from the user and outputs a predicted price using the SVR model. More information on this can be found at it's [repo](https://github.com/MichaelBryantDS/vehicle-price-pred-app).
